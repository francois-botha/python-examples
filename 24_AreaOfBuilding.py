# This program will be used to calculate the area that the foundation of a building covers.
# Ask the user to enter the shape of the building (square, rectangular or round)
# Based on the user‚Äôs input, prompt for the appropriate dimensions See what dimensions you need in the list of formulae below
# Calculate and display the area that will be taken up by the foundation of the building
# Formulae for area:
# Area of square = length of the square to the power of two (length 2 )
# Area of rectangle = length x width
# Area of circle = pi X radius squared (ùõ±radius 2)
# ===
